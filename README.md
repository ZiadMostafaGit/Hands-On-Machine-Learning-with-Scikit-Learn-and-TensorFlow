## Installation

To run the code examples and exercises from this repository, you'll need to set up your environment. The recommended way is to use a virtual environment.

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hands-on-ml.git
    cd hands-on-ml
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Each chapter directory contains:

- **Notes**: My personal notes on the chapter contents.
- **Exercises**: Solutions to the exercises from the book.
- **Projects**: Any additional projects or experiments based on the chapter's topics.

To run the Jupyter notebooks:
```sh
jupyter notebook
```
Navigate to the notebook you want to run in your web browser.
